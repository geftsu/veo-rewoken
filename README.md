The author hasn't touched the mod in several months and the mod has amassed a moderate amount of bug reports.
I decided to fix those bugs and maybe make some changes to this fork in the future.

## Disclaimer

At the moment I fixed the bugs in a vacuum, meaning that I haven't tested (or even looked) at the compatability patches yet. 
I also haven't tested how the mod behaves in heavily modded lists like in DIQ or with Arsenal Overhaul and so on.
I haven't looked into any reported bugs that are related to compatability with other mods.

It's part of my personal philosophy that before worrying about compatability and integrations, first the issues need to be 
resolved within the confines of the product itself. Compatability also shouldn't have to be something hacked into the main
mod itself.

Now that I fixed most bugs reported on the Nexus page of the original mod (with notable exception of a bug with Skybreaker
that will most likely require me to learn more about Script Extender and add it to the mod), I will look into compatability
issues next
